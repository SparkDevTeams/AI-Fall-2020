There is simply no other game that this can be compared to.
Maybe the original one, or one of its mods. But it's still very unique.
You will actually have to think to solve many of the puzzles in this game.
The story is hilarious. GLaDOS makes bad jokes, which is the whole point. It's like an anti-joke. It's funny because she's a robot, therefore making bad jokes.

Don't complain about Steam, as it is probably one of the most generous forms of DRM out there, and it is the best gaming client for Windows (and the only major one for OS X).

What's nice about the PS3 version is that after you play on the PS3 and link it to your Steam account, you unlock the PC/Mac version for FREE! (Yes, you need a PS3, and yes, you need PSN to work.)

I don't want to giveaway the details of the game, but Portal 2 delivers a truly unique, amazing experience.",There is no other game that can even come close...,1321228800,
5,FALSE,"11 11, 2011",A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B003O6E3C8,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},Trenton Bennett,"If you've already played Portal, you won't be disappointed with Portal 2:  it's more of the same, and then some more on top.  While the difficulty still has to start low and ramp itself up to get new players used to the world, it does so in a way that old players will find new and interesting.  This time around, top-notch voice-acting injects a wicked sense of humor into Portal 2 that is just perfect:  there were times my family came in the room simply to be in earshot of Portal 2's dialogue.

While I will go out of my way not to give you spoilers, I will tell you that the storyline for Portal 2 gives us a nice new level of depth while still bringing back some familiar themes.  It removes some of the isolation by making your relationship with your character just a bit more personal:  others who talk to you drop you little hints about your past.  Best of all, Portal 2 adds some very clever new 'items' to your interaction that bring entire new dimensions to the problem-solving you'll have to do.  There is a supporting cast of other characters--some of whom you never actually meet--but just like Gordon Freeman in Half-Life, you still play a silent partner in the story.

The concept behind Portal is simple:  you are trapped in a series of areas that have been designed to challenge your brain.  Each has puzzles that require you to do particular actions (press a switch, carry an object, etc.) in order to get to the exit, and each exit leads you on to the next level.  Some have obstacles, some have hazards...and some are downright deadly.

Where Portal is different is that it holds a first-person-shooter perspective but requires no fast-twitch skills.  You do need to be able to stomach some very dizzying spins and turns, and you will get at least a bit of vertigo at times when you're hurtling off a ledge aiming yourself at a narrow hole.  The only object you hold is a device capable of opening said hole: ""portals"" are inexplicable holes in reality.  Pop a hole in one wall, place an exit in another, and when you step through Hole A, out you go through Hole B.  Simple?  Not when you have to put a hole in the bottom of a pit, open another in a vertical wall, and then hope you fall into the pit fast enough that coming out the wall above you has enough momentum to throw you onto that platform on the other side of the room near the ceiling.  Not to worry--you won't be straining the laws of physics right away:  Portal 2 gradually works you towards the more complicated rooms at a very capable rate.  Just as in the first game, we have moments where we peek behind the curtain, but stepping outside of the rat-maze doesn't mean you get to stop thinking on your feet.

Portal 2 for the PS3 also offers a two-player co-op mode that takes our problem-solving skills to a new level:  instead of a competitive race to the end, it's all about teaming up, working together to get to the exit.  A perfect example of this is that there is one puzzle in which both of you need to reach the goal, and you will only be able too stop your hurtling momentum if each of you times things just right and crashes into the other...causing both of you to drop down exactly where you need to be.

Portal 2 for the PS3 comes with an added bonus:  it supports Valve's ""Steam"" system.  While controversial to PC Gamers, Steam is designed for the PS3 to be a point to track your savegames and trophies and upload screenshots.  The bonus comes in when you use an existing Steam account or create a new one:  tying Portal 2 into Steam will unlock a copy of the PC & Mac versions that you can play on any computer.

If you enjoy thinking on your feet, don't mind the first-person interface, and want something different from a shooter game, Portal 2 will fill your needs perfectly.  It is clever, it is funny, and it is paced just right to keep the frustration low and the fun factor high.","Not a Cakewalk, but Fun & Rewarding Just the Same",1320969600,

You will not regret buying this game. It's fun and frustrating to play. It's a problem solving game so you constantly have to figure out how to get yourself out of situations, some less obvious than others. I enjoyed every minute of it! Even the times when I gave up on a ""test"" in a fit.. I'd always come back later and be like ""OH! NOW I GET IT!"". This game is really funny as well.

ok, I didn't play the first portal so I just searched some info about the story trying to avoid any sopoiler from this one.

Pros:
- the game puzzle mechanics.
- story, there is not much to it but it's fun.
- characters are very likeable.
- voices are well done.

Cons:
- I found the puzzles to be fairly easy, except in 3 ocations from the midle to the end where I didn't kno what to do. thouse 3 ocations were very easy to overcome it's just that I didn't realize the simple solution.
- I beated the game in like 8 hours for the single player and same time for the local co-op.

And it is possible to give your Steam code to someone else so you can play with them.  Log onto Steam with the PS3 with the disc on your account, And on the account you're giving it to.  If there is no Steam/PS3 sync you can't use the code.

I love driving the tracks while enjoying the scenery.  The music is annoying and you have no choice to play your own.  Here are some issues I've consistently feel upset about, but ignore.

1. Using triple screens causes the sun to completely blind you in certain tracks.  I've read this is caused by a Frostbyte game engine setting.

2. Vehicle selection is decent, but you can't customize any vehicle.  You can choose from limited presets and liveries, but it does not alter the performance.

3. Vehicle physics and dynamics are OK for arcade.  However, cars do tend to fly up in the air and bounce off obstacles like rubber toys.

4. Traffic is rigged to collide with your vehicle.  Creep, stalk and ambush is the order of the day for the bot vehicles roaming the streets!

5. The story is good in concept, but brutally dumb in execution.  Get mentally prepared to race the same characters you had previously beaten or killed without explanation as you get closer to New York.  Why?  Because they said, that's why.

6. Cop cars have extraterrestrial engines able to develop infinite horsepower on demand without being affected by silly earthly gravity.  You'll also be forced to watch each take-down in SLOW motion because the designers thought it would be 'cool' to distract the driver during a race or chase.  Perfect!

7. There was minimal effort spent designing the multiplayer user interface.  The controls are limited and counter intuitive, as if designed for infants.

For example:
  a. To mute other players, you must do so during the race, which forces you to fall behind or crash.  This was an after-thought released in patch.  Brilliant!

  b. Good luck trying to chat with your friends after a race.  The arrogant designers decided they would force players to endure listening to their annoying music after every race race without providing options to mute it.  Nice Nazi approach EA!

  c. Voting for race sets is a joke!  Out of two set choices displayed side-by-side, if votes are tied, the system was programmed to pick the one on the left instead of randomizing.  Seriously dumb?

 d. No Vote-Kick system was even crudely implemented to rid of mentally challenged players who are just out to ruin races.  And, no support to ban these viruses' accounts either.  No need to waste money on nonsense like that, we live in a perfect world!

8. Constant lag when other players strike objects triggers the infamous rubber-banding effect which causes cars to have seizures, eventually hitting your car.  If you're lucky this will only slow your car, but more often destroying it.

9.  Recently the servers have been partially down rendering chat, mottoes, avatars and backgrounds useless.","If you like good looking Arcade racing games, buy this at a discount.",1395014400,

From course to course the objectives change between gaining a certain number of positions to picking up lost time or just defeating one particular opponent. They are sort of strung together because they have to be but they don't really have any flow or make sense. There is really no connection to the protagonist that you are playing as. There are scenes on the game that require you to get out of the car and run or escape some situation or person. They are awkward and out of place mini games.

 The first, and my favorite, game mode is Franchise Mode where you can pick your favorite NFL team(s) and draft players existing and non-existing in a fantasy draft. The cons on this game mode are that it gets old after a while and that there aren't any add-ons for this mode.

 Second, the NFL Superstar Mode, allows you to create your own player, his build, position, and number. This is fun at first but gets old doing the same thing over and over again and there obviously wasn't much work put into this mode, a disappointing example of this is that it may appear that you will be allowed to return kicks as a KR but won't allow you to do so.

Spoiler Alert!

I'm gonna explain the ending to you.

Elizabeth regains her ability to create Tears to where ever she wants to go and she can see all the choices past and present.

She shows Booker what he could become and what he did to her.

Unlike the other Bookers who either never made it to the end or accepted the baptism and became Comstock, he refuses the baptism and feels grief for his actions.

Booker lets Elizabeth drown him in the baptismal river to prevent Comstock from ever existing.

All things made by Zachary Comstock disappear and all things made by Booker Dewitt remain.

All of the other Elizabeths disappear because they were products of Comstock,

At the post credits scene Booker wakes up in 1893 New York and into a room with a cribs where you can hear a baby crying.

This means that there is Anna Dewitt and her alter ego Elzabeth Dewitt, just in different time periods.
