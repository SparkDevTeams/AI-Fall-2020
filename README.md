Summary:

- What is Natural Language Processing?
Language processing refers to the way humans use words to communicate ideas and feelings, and how such communications are processed and understood. Natural Language Processing (NLP), is broadly defined as the automatic manipulation of natural language, for the most part speech and text through software.

Tools Utilized:

Sentiment analysis: refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information.

Speech Tagging: this process involves labelling each word in a sentence with its appropriate part of speech.

Punctuation Remover: we utilized a punctuation remover to analyze each word separately, this also provides a cleaner data output.
